Executive Summary
- The motivation for this project is my own interest in listening and playing music. I Will be using the spotify API
  in conjunction with webscraping to attempt to answer the broad question: "What is the direction of music today, and how
  does it compare with the top music of past decades?"

Motivation 
- I have been a practicing musician since I was 10 years old, but also a huge fan of math. For this reason I have always
  taken an analytical approcach to learning music and have had a fascination with the component that make up good music.
  After looking into Spotify's API and the data it is able to provide, I got excited at the prospect of systematically looking
  at the facts and features that make up the music I love. 

Data question
- What features make up the newest music today? the most popular music of today? and how do these features compare with the 
  features of past generations of music? has our collective taste of what we like about music changed over time?

MVP
- Analysis of new music vs the top songs of past decades spanning back to the 1940s

Data Sources
- Anaylsis of the features and components of songs will all come from the spotify API. As for what songs get plugged into the
  API, these will be scraped from various sources on the web such as top songs lists from each decade.

Known issues and challenges
- interacting with the spotify api is a technical challenge, as there will need to be a good data flow since answering the 
  data question requires using multiple of the API endpoints in conjunction
    - However using an API will make the data come in a clean format that is ready to use
- web scraping for songs to plug into the API; the websites that I have seen from preliminary research are ill-formatted and 
  will require serious cleaning, especially if I pull from multiple websites
