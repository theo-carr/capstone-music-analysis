# What distinct features make up popular music today, and do these features differs from past generations of popular music?

## Inspiration
I am a lifelong musician and music lover. I have played piano since I was ten years old, and picked up guitar when I was sixteen. Due to this, I have always been drawn to older, more instrumental music. This got me thinking, are popular songs today really less instrumental? In comes the spotify API; an extensive, free resource that tracks "audio features" for each song they have available on their platform. These "audio features" consist of really cool stats such as *energy*, *danceability*, *speechiness*, and importantly *instrumentalness* 

## Methodology


## Introduction to notebook 
### The drivers behind the whole project
> the two most important documents in this repo are "spotifyAPI.py" and "data_collection_functions.py". These two python scripts were the fundamental drivers for collecting the data necessary for this project.
### SpotifyAPI.py
> SpotifyAPI.py is a custom module I wrote to help me interact with Spotify's API service. It includes functions that interact with each endpoint and return the response from that endpoint
