What is music like today, and how does it compare to music of the past?


--Data Flow---
1. get new releases (albums)
2. get_albums()
3. from get albums we can get all the tracks
4. from there we pull stats on the audio, and possibly advertising
    4a. going to just start with audio features, not audio analysis; that will be a stretch goal


--Stretch Ideas--
1. looking at different global markets 

2. looking at user info... maybe 

3.bring in some of the more techical audio analysis
